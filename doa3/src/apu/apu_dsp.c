/*
 * MCPX APU DSP (GP/EP) - Stub implementation
 *
 * The DSP Global Processor (GP) and Encode Processor (EP) handle effects
 * processing (reverb, chorus, etc.) and final output encoding. The full
 * DSP is ~3000 lines of DSP56300 emulation code.
 *
 * For initial audio, we bypass the DSP entirely:
 * - VP mixbins are passed directly to the EP output
 * - GP effects processing is skipped
 * - The EP just copies mixbin 0/1 (front L/R) to the monitor buffer
 *
 * This gives us basic voice playback without effects. The DSP can be
 * connected later for reverb, EQ, and other processing.
