/*
 * Cooperative fiber scheduler for Xbox threads.
 *
 * The recompiler is single-threaded: the x86 registers are global variables
 * (g_eax, g_esp, ...). DOA3's CRI ADXF middleware, however, is built around
 * worker threads (it spawns I/O server threads that block on events and process
 * a file-load queue). To run that faithfully we give each Xbox thread its own
 * Windows fiber (own native C stack) and round-robin between them cooperatively.
 *
 * Each fiber owns the recompiler register-globals while it runs; the scheduler
 * saves/restores them across switches. Yield points are the Xbox blocking
 * primitives (KeWaitForSingleObject) and the game's busy-wait spins. Because the
 * recomp is otherwise single-threaded there are no data races to lock against —
 * only one fiber runs at a time and it yields at well-defined points.
